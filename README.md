## Installation

Describe how to set up my Project locally. Include any dependencies and steps required to get the project running.


# Install dependencies
npm install
```

## Getting Started

Here's how to get started with my Project:

1. Make sure you've completed the installation steps mentioned above.
2. Set up the database: Create a MySQL database and configure the database connection in `config/database.js`.
3. Configure environment variables: Make sure you have the required environment variables set up, including database connection details and any necessary API keys.
4. Start the application: Run the following command to start the application.


npm start
```

My Project should now be up and running.

## Usage

Explain how to use my Project. Provide examples or code snippets if necessary.


# Start the application
npm start
```

## Database Configuration

My Project uses a MySQL database. Ensure you have the MySQL server set up and running. You can configure the database connection in `config/database.js`. If you're new to MySQL, follow these steps:

1. Install MySQL: [MySQL Installation Guide](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-installation-excerpt/8.0/en/)



## API Endpoints

List and describe the API endpoints available in my Project, including the request methods and expected responses. You can use tables or bullet points for clarity.

### Admin APIs

Admin APIs require admin authentication for access.

#### GET /api/admin/endpoint

- Description: Retrieve data
- Parameters: `parameter1` (type), `parameter2` (type)
- Response: `{ example: 'response' }`

#### POST /api/admin/endpoint

- Description: Create a new item
- Request body: `{ example: 'data' }`
- Response: `{ example: 'response' }`

#### PUT /api/admin/endpoint/:id

- Description: Update an item by ID
- Request body: `{ example: 'data' }`
- Response: `{ example: 'response' }`

#### DELETE /api/admin/endpoint/:id

- Description: Delete an item by ID
- Response: `{ message: 'Item deleted' }`

### User APIs

User APIs require user authentication for access.

#### GET /api/user/endpoint

- Description: Retrieve data
- Parameters: `parameter1` (type), `parameter2` (type)
- Response: `{ example: 'response' }`

#### POST /api/user/endpoint

- Description: Create a new item
- Request body: `{ example: 'data' }`
- Response: `{ example: 'response' }`

#### PUT /api/user/endpoint/:id

- Description: Update an item by ID
- Request body: `{ example: 'data' }`
- Response: `{ example: 'response' }`

#### DELETE /api/user/endpoint/:id

- Description: Delete an item by ID
- Response: `{ message: 'Item deleted' }`

## Authentication

My Project includes user authentication. It uses token-based authentication for admin and user access. Admins have access to admin APIs, while regular users have access to user APIs. To authenticate, obtain a token and include it in the request headers.

## Testing with Postman

You can test your APIs using Postman, a popular API testing tool. We've provided a Postman collection that includes example requests for my Project. You can find the Postman collection file here: [Postman Collection](postman/your-project.postman_collection.json).

To get started with Postman:

1. [Download Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).
2. Import the Postman collection.
3. Configure environment variables for my Project's endpoints and authentication.
4. Use the provided requests in the collection to test your APIs.
